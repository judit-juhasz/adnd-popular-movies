## Application secrets

In order to use The Movie DB service you need to register your own API
key (see [the documentation](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)).
To use your own API key in *Popular Movies* you will need to add it to
your local gradle configuration file. You can do that by adding the
following line to your `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle\gradle.properties` file:

    MyTheMovieDbApiKey="copy your api key here"

Here is an example:

    MyTheMovieDbApiKey="ajjs983i3JPEOIJD00384jdo203ks9732322jK"
